    "# Convert a 3D .nrrd file to a 2D tiff stack \n",
    "*Last edited 18 Nov 2024 by K. Wolcott*    \n",
    "Convert a 3D .nrrd file made in 3D Slicer into a stack of 2D tiff images, as well as a metadata file with scan parameters and any adjustments made while in 3D Slicer. This script is an alternative to manually converting .nrrd to tiff stack in Fiji. So far, it has only been tested on 16-bit unsigned CT data generated using Zeiss Versa Xradia 620. \n",
    "\n",
    "Anywhere you see \"TO DO\", you may need to adjust parameters to match your data and file structures."
